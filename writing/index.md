Besides this blog and its contents, there have been occasions where I wrote 
someting longer and oriented towards a different goal. This page lists out those 
writings for your reading pleasure. And also because I need a place where I can 
always find these. 

* [As Time Passes Us By: Temporal Dimensions in Formulas](http://anthroserbia.org/Journals/Article/123)

    *In this article, I shall deal with the concept of formula, created by John 
    Cawelti as a means of studying popular culture, mostly literature. Based on
     a difference between conventions and inventions, this concept promised a 
    lot of change in theoretical dealings with popular culture. However, some 
    changes are needed in its definition, since Cawelti didn't spend a lot of 
    time defining formula's mutation through time as well as its relation to 
    genre, another concept used in popular culture studies. I also investigate 
    in greater depth the aforementioned relation between convention and invention.*


* [Genre out of bounds: Fluidity of an analytical term](http://anthroserbia.org/Journals/Article/95)
    
    *In this article we have shown the changes that happen with genre and it's 
    forms when it is externalized in reality. In order to better explain and 
    illustrate that process, we have used the theories about genre as a point 
    of fixation of reality that were crafted by Mikhail Bakhtin, a russian 
    formalist. Through a very special process of classificaiton on a hybrid 
    body of narratives, we have seen how rigid and one-sided process of 
    classification, which treats genre as a category fixed in time and space, 
    ultimately damages our analysis of folklore materials.*

* [On Something out of Nothing and Positronic Souls: Anthropology, Science Fiction and Technology](http://anthroserbia.org/Publications/Details/41)

    *Science fiction was, both as a literary genre and through its presence in 
    film and television, the object of many disciplines until pre- sent time. 
    The idea of inevitable technological progress and scientific de- velopment 
    as basis of the future of human worlds is present as one of key science 
    fiction motifs. This paperâ€™s aim is to use the specificities of anthropology
     as a discipline so it could observe reflections of the con- struction and
     constitution of technological systems, and, even more im- portantly, their 
    promises in science fiction literature and genre in general.*
