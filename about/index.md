title: About

In the real world, my name is Zlatko Knežević, but people like to call me "Z". 
Just Z. Not "Zed", which is very important, because "Zed's dead baby, Zed's dead". 
I like to think of myself as a leftie with strong affinity for programming, 
science fiction and various trivia around things that most people don't really 
care about. 

My general moto is [*I aim to misbehave*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VR3Av9qfZc). 
I just had to put it in there.

## What do I work on day to day?
For the past 10-ish years I've been working for Microsoft on variety of stuff, 
most notably being an Evangelist in Central Eastern Europe, working as a PM on 
SQL Server and other data properties. Currently, I'm a member of the .NET Team, 
working primarily on the cross-platform experience for 
[CoreCLR](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr), trying to make it as smooth as 
possible, so developers can have a **very** good time using it to develop 
modern applications. 

## About this blog
This blog represents my opinions on several topics, from computing to social 
problems, anthropology, leftism and others. It is in no way representative of 
opinions of my employer. I know, sounds cheesy, but I have to have it on there
somewhere.

Blog is built using the amazing [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com/) static 
site/blog generator, and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). 

It is also using a very pretty theme called [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) 
built by [@mdo](https://github.com/mdo), with some changes for links and the 
like.
