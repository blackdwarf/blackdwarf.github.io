## "I aim to misbehave"

You can always follow me on Twitter, as well as check out my GitHub profile.

## The daily work
I work for Microsoft currently on the .NET team, building out the Microsoft 
development platform and striving to make it a succesfull open-source project 
as well as make the experience of cross-platform development a smooth and good 
one. 

## About the blog
This blog represents my oppinions on several topics, from computing to social 
problems, anthropology, leftism and others. It is in no way representative of 
opinions of my employer. 

This blog is built using the amazing [Jekyll]() static site/blog generator, 
and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). 

It is also using a very pretty theme called [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) 
built by [@mdo](https://github.com/mdo), with some changes for links and the 
like. Still encourage you to take a look, it is very nice.
